//! Per-scan timestamp normalization.
//!
//! `ScanContext` carries the single `scan_time` captured at the top of a
//! discovery submission so every entity created or refreshed during that
//! submission shares one timestamp. Without it, each entity's `Utc::now()`
//! call drifts by microseconds-to-milliseconds across the host + children
//! tree, which makes session-window timestamp filters fuzzy at the
//! boundaries (per-scan diff queries become unreliable when entities from
//! the same scan straddle the [`started_at`, `finished_at`] cut).
//!
//! Scope of stamping: when a `ScanContext` is provided to
//! `HostService::discover_host`, the handler stamps `created_at`,
//! `valid_from`, and `last_seen_at` on the incoming host plus every child
//! entity (ip_addresses, ports, services, interfaces, subnets) to
//! `scan_time` BEFORE the entities reach the storage layer. Upsert paths
//! that refresh `last_seen_at` on a matched live row use the incoming
//! entity's already-stamped value, so all writes within one scan share
//! the same timestamp.

/**
 * When SvelteFlow may cull off-screen nodes and edges.
 *
 * At a few hundred hosts the L2 view mounts ~1250 nodes and >20,000 DOM
 * elements, and panning spends most frames over the 50ms jank threshold.
 * Viewport culling is the direct fix, but it cannot simply be switched on:
 *
 *  - **The measure pass needs every node in the DOM.** It mounts all nodes and
 *    reads their heights; culled nodes never mount, so it would time out and
 *    hand ELK fallback sizes.
 *  - **Export rasterises the whole flow element** (`html-to-image`), so a
 *    culled graph exports cropped.
 *
 * Note this helps *interaction*, not the cold load: SvelteFlow force-renders a
 * node until its `handleBounds` exist, and those only appear once a node has
 * mounted and been measured (`@xyflow/system`: `forceInitialRender =
 * !node.internals.handleBounds`). Since the pipeline rebuilds node objects
 * without a `measured` field on every run, everything renders at least once
 * regardless. Panning afterwards is where culling pays.

 *    card measures its pinned height rather than its content's, so the pass would confirm whatever
 *    the last measurement happened to be and ELK would inherit it. Suspending here is also what
 *    makes the height pin correct: measured heights are always full-detail heights, so a reduced
 *    card pinned to `measured` occupies exactly the box the layout was built around and nothing
 *    reflows as the threshold is crossed.
 *  - **`exporting`** — `html-to-image` rasterises the flow element as it stands, so an export taken
 *    below the threshold would be a page of empty rectangles.
 *
 * Tooling shares `__topoNoCull` rather than getting a second flag: anything reading the graph out
 * of the DOM wants it whole and detailed, which is the same thing that switch already means.

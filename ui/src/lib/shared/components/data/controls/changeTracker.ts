/**
 * Tracks whether a value has changed since it was last observed, treating the
 * first observation as "no change".
 *
 * Three effects need this shape: ordering, search, and the tag filter each have
 * to tell the parent when the user changed something, and each has to stay
 * quiet on the run that merely restores saved state. Firing on that first run
 * would reset the restored page to 1 on every mount, so the skip is load-bearing
 * rather than an optimisation.
 *
 * The comparison is supplied because the values are not all primitives — a tag
 * filter is a list, where identity says nothing about equality.

/**
 * The blank classifier decided a customer report and had no coverage at all.
 *
 * Its output is what latches the one-shot `firstBlank` capture, so a wrong answer does not just
 * mislead a reader — it spends the evidence. A capture came in whose only blank row was a frame
 * that had never been on screen, taken before the renderer had caught up with a viewport change,
 * which left the fault being reported absent from the file entirely.
 *
 * These pin the decision itself. Whether the caller samples at the right moment is a separate
 * question, answered by `sampleOnNextFrame` in the viewer.

/**
 * The zoom floor, and the bounds it is derived from.
 *
 * A fixed floor of 0.1 is what made a large estate unfittable: `getViewportForBounds` clamps to it,
 * so a graph needing 0.03 was centred and shown at a third of its width with the rest off-screen,
 * and `F` recomputed the same clamped transform every time. A capture had all 31 samples at exactly
 * `scale(0.1)` across two views and four collapse levels — eight separate fits, all clamping.

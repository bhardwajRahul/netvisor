/**
 * The frontend half of the title contract.
 *
 * The ladder itself is `Host::display_name` and is tested in Rust — asserting its rungs again here
 * would be a second copy of the thing this whole change exists to remove. What is genuinely
 * frontend behaviour is the last step: `display_name` is `Option<String>` on the wire, and every
 * surface has to render *one* deliberate thing when it is absent rather than each inventing its
 * own `?? ''`.
